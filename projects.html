    Participant in funded Research Project
Involved in Department of Biotechnology (DBT) project at IIT Guwahati
Development of sustainable agriculture practices for biotic and abiotic stress management in conventional and organic tea plantations May 22 – Feb,24
Department of Biotechnology (DBT) through NER-BPMC (BT/PR45283/NER/95/1919/2022)
• Water-absorbing polymer developed in-house for drought mitigation
• Investigate the effect of WAP on tea plant growth by measuring soil and plant parameters.
</p>

Ph.D. thesis:
Unsaturated soil behavior under the combined influence of water-absorbing polymer and vegetation. June 19 – April, 24
• Evaluate the combined effect of different materials on the soil water characteristics curve (SWCC)
• Effect of water-absorbing polymer on induced soil suction in vegetated soil
• Wilting characteristics of different vegetation on induced soil suction with WAP amendment
• Impact of vegetation-microbes interaction on WAP performance and unsaturated soil properties
• Long-term effect of WAP (WAP degradation) in the unsaturated soil subjected to multiple drying-wetting cycles of SWCC
</p>
<p>
Involved in projects during visiting scholar June 23 – October, 23
1) Influence of biochar-amended soil on plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC)
• Evaluate the soil water characteristics of biochar-aided plant microbial fuel cell
• Relation between bioelectricity and unsaturated soil properties of biochar-aided PMFC
2) Influence of microbial-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) on unsaturated soil properties.
• Effect of MICP on water retention behavior of unsaturated soil
• Impact of MICP on gas permeability and electrical resistivity in soil matrix
</p>
<p>
Master's thesis
Influence of water-absorbing polymer on water retention characteristics of cohesive and cohesionless soil May 18 – May 19
• Evaluate the characterization of WAP in terms of water uptake and releasing mechanism
• Influence of salinity on the water-absorbing capacity of WAP
• Effect of WAP on the water retention behavior (SWCC) of unsaturated soil in different textured soil under drying condition
• Explore the performance of WAP by varying the amendment concentration in the soil matrix
